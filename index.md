I'm a researcher and PhD student [at Humboldt-University](https://www.wiwi.hu-berlin.de/de/professuren/bwl/wi/personen/johannes-haupt). I work and post on causal machine learning/uplift modeling and neural networks.

Some insights and code have not made it into papers so far, others have made it into papers that deserve a more accessible write-up, so check out the blog for tutorials, deep dives and code snippets.

Get in touch if you want to chat or collaborate on uplift modeling, profit-driven decision support or changing people's actions!
