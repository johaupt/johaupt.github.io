I'm a senior data scientist at [remerge](https://remerge.io) after doctoral studies at the information systems group at [Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin](https://www.wiwi.hu-berlin.de/de/professuren/bwl/wi/). I work on causal machine learning, uplift modeling and Bayesian analysis in experimental settings. Check out the blog for tutorials on causal machine learning, code walkthroughs and insights that have not made it into papers so far.

I also love longboarding and learning about the Chinese cultural sphere as a member of [sinonerds e.V.](https://sinonerds.com).

Get in touch if you want to chat about any of the above or collaborate on uplift modeling or customer targeting!
