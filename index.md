I'm a researcher and PhD student [at Humboldt-University](https://www.wiwi.hu-berlin.de/de/professuren/bwl/wi/personen/johannes-haupt). I work on causal machine learning, uplift modeling and neural networks.

Check out the blog for tutorials and code walkthroughs of insights that have not made it into papers so far or have made it into papers that deserve a practical write-up.

I'm available to consult on projects on causal machine learning or reinforcement/policy learning. Please send me an email summarizing your goals, status of the project and your timeline and I'll be happy to make you an offer.

Get in touch if you want to chat or collaborate on uplift modeling, prescriptive decision support or just changing people's actions!
