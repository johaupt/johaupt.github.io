I'm a researcher and PhD student [at Humboldt-University](https://www.wiwi.hu-berlin.de/de/professuren/bwl/wi/personen/johannes-haupt). I work on causal machine learning/uplift modeling and neural networks.

Check out the blog for tutorials and code walkthroughs of insights that have not made it into papers so far or have made it into papers that deserve a more accessible write-up.

Get in touch if you want to chat or collaborate on uplift modeling, profit-driven decision support or just changing people's actions!
