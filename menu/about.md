I'm a researcher and PhD student [at Humboldt-University](https://www.wiwi.hu-berlin.de/de/professuren/bwl/wi/personen/johannes-haupt). I work and post on profit-driven modeling and causal machine learning/uplift modeling. 

Some insights and code have not made it into papers so far, others have made it into papers that deserve a more accessible write-up, so check out the blog for tutorials, deep dives and code snippets.

Get in touch if you enjoy uplift, heterogeneous treatment effects or changing people's actions!
