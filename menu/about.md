Iâ€™ve been working on applications in profit-driven and causal machine learning during [my PhD at Humboldt-University](https://www.wiwi.hu-berlin.de/de/professuren/bwl/wi/personen/johannes-haupt). 

Some insights and code have not made it into papers so far, others have made it into papers that deserve a more accessible write-up, so this blog will be an alternative outlet to share explanations and code snippets.
